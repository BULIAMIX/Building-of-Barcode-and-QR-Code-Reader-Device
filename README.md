# Building of a device to scan Barcode and QR code (1D/2D) reader 


  # Choice of Materials Used :
     Maikrt Embedded Q#R Code Scanning Module
       Arduino Nano
         Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)
           6VDC REGULATED POWER SUPPLY
             Arduino IDE is used to write the computer code to the physical board (Arduino Nano)  
              

Journal was published on this project which i think it will gives full detail on how the device was built for anyone that want full detail about the device please visit ResearchGate by checking the link below

  Further research  can  be conducted  to  improve the  efficiency  of the  constructed barcode and QR code reader device by adding indicators to the device when the battery is full and low.
